## 📷 Interface Overview


Below, users select a CSV file and an output location. Clicking **Convert** writes the `.bin` file with the raw hex bytes from the CSV.

---


📂 File Format
CSV files should contain hexadecimal byte values (e.g., 85,06,FF,7C)

The app strips whitespace and empty values

Each value is converted to a raw byte (0x85, 0x06, etc.)

🛠️ Customization
Place your icons in a folder named icons/ next to main.py:

```bash
css
Copy
Edit
csv-to-bin/
├── icons/
│   ├── csv.png
│   ├── arrow.png
│   └── bin.png
├── main.py
├── config.json (autogenerated)
└── README.md
```

## 🔧 Gitignore suggestion
Add config.json to .gitignore to keep filepaths private

```bash
gitignore
Copy
Edit
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.venv/
.env/
uv.cache/
config.json
```

## 💡 Future Improvements
Drag-and-drop support for CSV files and output folders

Dark mode toggle

Package as a standalone .exe with PyInstaller

Add "Reset Preferences" button in the GUI

Optional byte-swapping / endianness settings
